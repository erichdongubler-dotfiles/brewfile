# `brewfile`

This is my set of packages that I prefer to install on all Mac machines that I use. It's an implementation detail of [`platform-macos`](https://github.com/erichdongubler-dotfiles/platform-macos).

You can regenerate this file with `brew bundle dump` with this file's parent as the CWD.
